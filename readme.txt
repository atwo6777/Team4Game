**Source code is all within the appropriate folders in the Source folder**

DOWNLOAD CODE
Clone the Github project if you haven't. If you have, sync/refresh the project to get changes.

ADDING CODE
In Unreal, click "Add New" and then choose the appropriate option for what you're doing. Name it appropriately with your initials. Then, move the .h and .cpp file that are created to the /inc and /src folders within the Source folder. You can do this within your text editor or outsize it. If you do it outside, make sure you refresh your solution. Make sure that you include headers like this: "../../inc/myHeader.h"

BUILDING CODE
Build the project from within your text editor (probably Visual Studio to see changes you've made take effect. Create an executable by choosing File -> Package and then your OS in Unreal.
